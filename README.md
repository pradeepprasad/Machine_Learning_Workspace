# Machine_Learning_Workspace

This is main repository where machine learning model experiments are saved for future reference. Models are trained using TensorFlow 2 and Keras. Transfer learning using MobileNet, ResNet and other effective NN architectures. Matplotlib is being used for visualization which will be later migrated to SeaBorn APIs.
